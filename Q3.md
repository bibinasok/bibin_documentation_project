Subject: Optic Image Stabilisation (OIS) shaking 
Hello,
This is your technical head. 
The ‘xyz-123’ smartphone is reporting issues on rear camera shaking violently, having blurry videos, and failure in image stabilization.
 Recommend these steps in ascending order for assistance.
  1) Cleaning the camera lens with cotton cloth in a circular motion.
  2) Recommend to check if the software is up-to-date. (If the issue began after a recent software update the company will cover the cost. If under the one-year warranty period)
  3) Recommend a restart of the handset. 
  4) Check with the customer if they have been mounting their handset in vehicles. Explain how the vibration from the vehicle can cause the camera to malfunction. Thus, advised to change the camera lens which was damaged due to excessive vibration from the vehicle. (Recommend a visit to the service centre)
  5) Recommend a service centre visit to flash the software (to re-install the software from the service centre)
