An ATM card is a small plastic card from your bank that helps you access your money. You can use it to withdraw cash, check your balance, and deposit money. Here’s how you can use an ATM card if you are visually impaired.

The ATM card has raised numbers on the front, including a 16-digit number, your name, and the expiration date. You can feel these with your fingers to identify the card. The back has a magnetic strip and a place for your signature.

To use the ATM, find a machine that has an audio jack for headphones. Plug in your headphones to hear audio instructions. First, insert your card into the slot on the ATM. The machine will guide you on how to insert it correctly.
Next, you need to enter your Personal Identification Number (PIN). The keypad has a raised dot on the number 5 to help you find the right keys. Enter your PIN by feeling the keys.

Follow the audio instructions to choose what you want to do, like withdrawing cash or checking your balance. The machine will talk you through each step. When you’re done, the ATM will tell you to take your card back and collect any cash or receipt.

To stay safe, keep your PIN private and use your hand to cover the keypad when you enter it. Also, check your bank statements regularly to make sure there are no mistakes.
Using an ATM card with these steps helps you manage your money independently and safely. With practice, you can confidently use ATMs and take control of your finances.
